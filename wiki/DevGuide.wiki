= Introduction =

If you want to enhance peter-bochs, here is the development guide

= Tools we need =

My primary development environment is Fedora 13 + JDK 1.6.x. You can develop peter-bochs in windows too, but if you are enhancing "peter-bochs instrument", you have to do it in linux because "peter-bochs instrument" only work in linux at the moment.

! "peter-bochs instrument" is a profiling/sampling module, you can use it to profile your assembly program. please take a look [http://code.google.com/p/peter-bochs/wiki/JmpProfiling this] and [http://code.google.com/p/peter-bochs/wiki/MemorySampling_ChineseIntroduction this].

= setup your development tool =

Please follow the steps to start develop peter-bochs

== Step 1 , download everything ==

Please download [http://www.eclipse.org eclipse] and [http://java.sun.com java].

== Step 2 , checkout dependence project from svn ==

To build/test peter-bochs in eclipse, you need to download [http://code.google.com/p/petersoft-java-style-2/ petersoft-java-style-2]. petersoft-java-style-2 is a Swing Look & feel, I use it to make peter-bochs look better.

Please checkout the source from [http://code.google.com/p/petersoft-java-style-2/source/checkout here] and import the source to eclipse like :

== Step 4, install Jigloo and Fatjar ==

I use these two plugins

Jigloo - Swing graphical editor
Fatjar - I use this to pack the whole project into a single jar file, that jar file is the one you find in the dowload page
